    <h1>Backpacking</h1>

    <p>I love backpacking! In my humble opinion it is some of the best fun you can have in life. Especially if you do it with friends! I started backpacking shortly after highscool.
         It took me a while to save up the money for good gear but it was totally worth it! </p>
    <p>There is a common miscopection that backpacking is very dangerous and that it requires the most demanding of mountaineering skills. This is far from the truth. 
        Before I started going on trips I had only completed normal hikes. While I was in good shape from doing sports in high school I was far from a mountineer. 
        If I can start doing this than anyone can.... more or less haha. </p>

    <p>Some of the most favorte trips that I've been on so far have been in nothern Idaho (about 1.5hrs from where I grew up). I want to visit most of the national parks and I think I found a way to do it <a href='#parkplans'>here!</a> </p>

    <p>Alot of the skills that I've learned come from... you guessed it the Internet!! In particular I love to watch one creator in partiuclar called Xander Budnick. 
        He's from Canada and does lots of trips all throughout the year! His videos are long and mostly quite with some simple monolog in the backround.
        But they bring such a peace a calm as well as teach a lot of pratical shelter ideas, how to start a fire and cook effectivly, and much more. I'll link one of his videos below so you guys can check it out!</p>

    <p>For those of you that want to get into backpacking or camping in general I have some basic tips and trick for you: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start off easy!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dont do a 12 miles hike with 5,000ft evelation your first time around. It just wont go well.</li>
            <li>There's no shame in starting small, plus it will give you a feel for what types of terrain you are unfamiliar with.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Dont cheap out on gear!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not buy cheap low quality gear!</li>
            <li>Good gear is generally more water resistant, lighter, and lasts much longer. So save up! Its worth it in the long run.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Have Fun with it!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Grab some friends and do a quick overnighter!</li>
            <li>Dont feel presured to go more extream than your down for... also don't live a shell the whole time either.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Please do not be the person that plays music outloud on the trail. Nobody likes that.</li>
    </ol>
